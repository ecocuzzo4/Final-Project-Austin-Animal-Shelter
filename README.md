# Final Project - Austin Animal Shelter 

Final Project for General Assembly's Data Science Foundations 

By: Emilee Cocuzzo

March 2020

## Objectives
Approximately over 6.5 million animals are brought to animal shelters.
My goal is to find out which animals are more likely to be adopted and why.


## Insights
Dogs are adopted more than cats.
Younger animals are usually adopted more than older animals.

## Recommendations
Have an emphasis on adopting, returning to owner, or transferring.

Tactics: Marketing, hosting fun events at the shelter, finding creative ways to showcase the animals.

## Dataset
